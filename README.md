## Introduction

The field of natural language processing has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with language models such as GPT-3.5 achieving remarkable performance. However, to leverage the full potential of these models, effective prompt engineering is essential. Prompts are the input instructions given to the model, and crafting them carefully can greatly enhance the quality and relevance of the generated output.

## Getting Started

Before diving into prompt engineering, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of natural language processing, deep learning, and the fundamentals of language models. If you're new to these concepts, we suggest reviewing the prerequisite materials listed in the **Course Overview** section.

To get started with the Prompt Engineering Guide, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/prompt-engineering-guide.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the **Prompt_Engineering_Guide.ipynb** notebook.
5. Follow along with the lessons and examples provided.

## Course Overview

The Prompt Engineering Guide is designed as a comprehensive course that covers various aspects of prompt engineering. It provides step-by-step instructions, best practices, and real-world examples to help you craft effective prompts for your language models.

The course is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Prompt Engineering:** Learn about the importance of prompt engineering and its impact on model performance.
2. **Understanding Model Capabilities:** Explore the capabilities and limitations of language models to better utilize them.
3. **Defining Goals and Constraints:** Learn how to define clear goals and constraints for generating desired outputs.
4. **Crafting Effective Prompts:** Discover techniques for creating prompts that produce high-quality and contextually relevant responses.
5. **Handling Ambiguity and Bias:** Understand how to identify and mitigate potential sources of ambiguity and bias in prompts.
6. **Evaluating and Iterating:** Explore methods for evaluating and iterating on prompt engineering strategies to improve results.

Each section includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and coding exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Jupyter Notebook

The Prompt Engineering Guide is presented in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive learning environment. Jupyter Notebook allows you to run code cells, modify examples, and experiment with different prompt engineering techniques.

The notebook is structured in a logical sequence, making it easy to follow along. Each section includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to enhance your learning experience.

## Extending the Course

Our aim is to continuously expand and enhance the Prompt Engineering Guide to encompass a wide range of topics and use cases. We encourage contributions from the community to help us achieve this goal.
